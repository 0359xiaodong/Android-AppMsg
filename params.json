Based on [Toast](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html) notifications and article [The making of Prixing #4: in-layout notifications](http://android.cyrilmottier.com/?p=773) by [Cyril Mottier](http://www.cyrilmottier.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nToast is far from being perfect and I am not entirely satisfied with it. \r\nToast can be un-accurate in some cases. Indeed, Toast has one major drawback: it completely breaks contexts. \r\nThis issue can be reproduced effortless. Let’s say a user is currently in an app firing a Toast and wants to switch to another application using the dedicated “multitask” button. \r\nThe Toast will remain on screen even if the brought-to-front application has nothing do to with the previously shown app as described on the following figure:\r\n![Example Image][1]\r\n\r\nAs you can easily notice, the problem with Toasts is they are persistent. \r\nOnce a Toast has been fired, it is displayed on top of any screen and remains visible for the duration specified at its creation.\r\n\r\nIn order to bypass the Toast persistence problem and ensure information is displayed in the correct context, we decided to create a new notification system: \r\nActivity-bound notifications. This is what it looks like in the current version of Prixing:\r\n![Example Image][2]\r\n\r\nCrouton overcomes the main issue of having a Toast being shown while the menu is open. \r\nIt sticks to the current screen sliding with it and leaving the menu completely free of any information that would have not been related to it.\r\n\r\n<b>Copyright (C) by Cyril Mottier</b>\r\n\r\nSample\r\n------\r\n\r\nA sample application is available on Google Play:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devspark.appmsg.sample\">\r\n  <img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\"\r\n       src=\"http://www.android.com/images/brand/get_it_on_play_logo_small.png\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n![Example Image][3]\r\n\r\nThe source code is available in this repository.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis library is compatible from API 4 (Android 1.6).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe sample project requires:\r\n\r\n* The library project\r\n* [ActionBarSherlock](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock)\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAndroid AppMsg is presented as an [Android library project](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html).\r\nYou can include this project by [referencing it as a library project](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject) in Eclipse or ant.\r\n\r\nTo display the item you need the following code:\r\n\r\n* Show AppMsg:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nAppMsg.makeText(/*Activity*/, /*CharSequence*/, /*AppMsg.Style*/).show();\r\n```\r\n\r\nGradle\r\n------\r\n\r\nAndroid-AppMsg Library is now pushed to Maven Central as a AAR, so you just need to add the following dependency to your build.gradle.\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\ndependencies {\r\n\tcompile 'com.github.johnkil.android-appmsg:appmsg:1.1.1'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Gradle project using Android-AppMsg:\r\n\r\n* [Android-AppMsg-Gradle-Sample](https://github.com/johnkil/Android-AppMsg-Gradle-Sample)\r\n\r\n\r\nContribution\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease fork [dev](https://github.com/johnkil/Android-AppMsg/tree/dev) repository and contribute back using [pull requests](https://github.com/johnkil/Android-AppMsg/pulls).\r\n\r\nContributors are recommended to follow the Android [Code Style Guidelines](http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html).\r\n\r\nAny contributions, large or small, major features, bug fixes, additional language translations, unit/integration tests are welcomed and appreciated but will be thoroughly reviewed and discussed.\r\n\r\nDeveloped By\r\n------------\r\n* Evgeny Shishkin - <johnkil78@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2012 Evgeny Shishkin\r\n    \r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n    \r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n    \r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://cyrilmottier.com/media/2012/07/the-making-of-prixing-4-activity-tied-notifications/toast_user_flow_fail.png\r\n[2]: http://cyrilmottier.com/media/2012/07/the-making-of-prixing-4-activity-tied-notifications/in_layout_notification.png\r\n[3]: http://i46.tinypic.com/21kywit.png\r\n","google":"UA-37227385-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
